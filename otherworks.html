<h2><em>Eagle Scout Project</em></h2>
  <p> I recently completed my Eagle Project for Boy Scouts. This project took overall 4-5 months to complete. I created a 40ft long shed at my local temple for the cows living in the area. Before we created this shed, there was only one rotten shed in the worksite. Attemping to recreate that shed, my 10 pillar shed came to life. Besides my Eagle Project, I'm working on completing the rest of my requirements to become an Eagle Scout.  </p>

<h2><em>TP Organization</em></h2>
  <p> The summer before freshman year, I partnered with a good friend of mine in Pennslyvania. We decided to start virtual classes for elementary/middle school kids over the summer. Two other team members joined our side, however they aren't teaching this year. When we started, the goal was to educate those coming out of the COVID pandemic. Going to the 3rd year of teaching, i hope to expand this team more and expand the topics I get to teach. </p>

<h2><em>Carnegie Hall</em></h2>
  <p> Last summer, I also got the opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York City. With my dance team, we performed a garba piece. Garba is a form of Indian dance. Garba is a very energetic dance with many beats (dhol) and expressive movements that spreads across the stage. It took my team over 10 months to reach this point due to COVID delays. However, I am extremely grateful I got this opportunity to express one of my favorite forms of dance on a big stage celebrating and promoting Indian culture/dance. </p>
